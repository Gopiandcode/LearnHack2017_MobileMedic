============================

A moodle plugin that builds on Block BCU Course Checks.

This block performs a series of configurable automated checks on a moodle course to encourage a minimum standard of course quality.
The block can also "Clear down" a course, removing all sections that don't have content.

The checks that can be carried out by this block are:

* Has the course got a summary, and image set?
* Is the course visible to students?
* Has guest access been disabled on the course (helps prevent issues with automatically enrolled students)
* Have the sections been renamed from their default heading?
* Have all of the sections got a summary?
* Have all sections got content
* What blocks should each course have added to them?

> TODO:
* Pageranking
* Link checking
